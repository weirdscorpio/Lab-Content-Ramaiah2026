Our dress code policy contains:
   • "Business casual attire"
   • "Jeans permitted"
   • "No shorts or flip-flops"

But employees search using:
   • "clothing rules" (not "attire" or "policy")
   • "what to wear" (not "dress code")
   • "office fashion" (not "business casual")

SQL LIKE only matches EXACT words:
   ❌ "clothing" ≠ "attire" (even though they mean the same!)
   ❌ "rules" ≠ "policy" (even though they mean the same!)
   ❌ "wear" ≠ "dress" (even though they're related!)

Result: 67% of queries FAIL even though the answer EXISTS!

📈 Success Rate: Only 33% (1 out of 3 queries worked)
   • Query 1 ✅: Used exact words from the policy
   • Query 2 ❌: Used synonyms (clothing/attire)
   • Query 3 ❌: Used related words (wear/dress)
